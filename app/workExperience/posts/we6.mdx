* I established key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on mobility, integrity, and traffic to ensure the stability of the mobile network and meet company objectives. A significant part of my role involved troubleshooting system failures, working to identify the root causes and implement long-term solutions to prevent recurrence. I used automated testing tools to assess network performance based on data gathered from field tests. This analysis provided valuable insights into network behavior and areas for improvement. To streamline network configuration, I developed automated scripts for 4G nodes. Finally, I conducted interference analysis to diagnose and resolve network issues, such as dropped calls and traffic degradation, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience.
